üêç **Deep Learning** with **TensorFlow** üêç

Learning **AI Deep Learning** / **Machine Learning**.</br>
I tried to keep it as short as possible, but Truth needs to be told, **Machine Learning** is a big topic. </br>
In this Repository, the focus is mainly on **TensorFlow**.

## What is a neural network?

A basic **neural network** consists of an **input layer**, which is just **your data, in numerical form**. After your **input layer**, you will have some number of what are called **"hidden" layers**. **A hidden layer** is just in between your input and output layers.</br> ***One hidden layer means you just have a neural network. Two or more hidden layers? you've got a deep neural network!***

## What is a Tensor?

Each operation takes a **Tensor** as an Input and outputs a **Tensor**.</br>
A **Tensor** is how Data is represented in **TensorFlow**.</br>
A **Tensor is a multidimensional array** ex: </br>
([0.245,0.618,0.382], </br>[0.618,0.382,0.245], </br>[0.382,0.245,0.618]). </br>
This would be a **normalized three-way-tensor**.</br>
**normalized** in **TensorFlow** means that the numbers are converted to a value between 0 and 1.</br> The Data needs to be **normalized**, to be actually useable in **TensorFlow**.
