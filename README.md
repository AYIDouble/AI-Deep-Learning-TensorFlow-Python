## What is a neural network?

A basic **neural network** consists of an **input layer**, which is just **your data, in numerical form**. After your **input layer**, you will have some number of what are called **"hidden" layers**. **A hidden layer** is just in between your input and output layers.</br> ***One hidden layer means you just have a neural network. Two or more hidden layers? you've got a deep neural network!***
